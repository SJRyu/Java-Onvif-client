An example of using JAX-WS into Onvif-client.

I made an example program, "main" for testing a JNI project. so you can ignore the wrapper and polling motion.
you can use onvif client more properly and use real async api.
(But for motion event, Pratically better check the status each time instead of using wait or callback.)

Eclipse with JDK 7 or higher.
